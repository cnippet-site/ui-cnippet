## Installation Guide

<Steps>
<Step>
Create a New Next.js Project
</Step>

Start by creating a new Next.js **project**. You can use either npm or pnpm:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```
During the setup, you'll be prompted with several options. Here's what we recommend:

```plaintext
✔ What is your project named? ... my-app
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? ... Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? ... Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... Yes
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? ... No
✔ Would you like to use App Router? ... Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? ... Yes
✔ What import alias would you like configured? ... @/*
```

This will create a new Next.js project with Tailwind CSS already configured and ready to use.

<Step>
Download Components
</Step>

You can get all the components from our GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cnippet/ui-cnippet.git
```

Or download them directly from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cnippet/ui-cnippet). The repository includes all components, examples, and additional utilities.

<Step>
Add the utility helper
</Step>

Create a `lib/utils.ts` file to manage Tailwind CSS classes. This utility helps combine Tailwind classes efficiently and handles class name conflicts:

```tsx
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

First install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge
```

<Step>
Install icons
</Step>

Add Lucide React icons for consistent and beautiful iconography:

```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

Lucide provides a comprehensive set of icons that are used throughout our components.

<Step>
That's it
</Step>

You can now start adding components to your project. Each component can be imported from the components directory:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
```

You can also choose manual installation and copy the code directly from each component's page in our documentation.

For any issues or questions, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cnippet/ui-cnippet/issues) or join our community discussions.
